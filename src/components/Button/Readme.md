Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

### Text Buttons

Text buttons are typically used for less-pronounced actions

```js
<Button>Neutral</Button>
<Button color="primary">Primary</Button>
<Button color="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button disabled>Disabled</Button>
```

### Outlined Buttons

Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons.
They contain actions that are important, but arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.

```js
<Button varient="outlined">Neutral</Button>
<Button varient="outlined" color="primary">Primary</Button>
<Button varient="outlined" color="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button varient="outlined" disabled>Disabled</Button>
```

### Contained Buttons

Contained buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

```js
<Button varient="contained">Neutral</Button>
<Button varient="contained" color="primary">Primary</Button>
<Button varient="contained" color="secondary">Secondary</Button>
<Button varient="contained" disabled>Disabled</Button>
```
